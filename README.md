# K-means-Clustering
# 🧠 K-Means Clustering Project

This project demonstrates how K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, can be applied to group data into distinct clusters based on feature similarity. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and cluster interpretation.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The main goal is to implement K-Means Clustering to:
- Automatically identify patterns and group similar data points
- Visualize clusters in 2D or 3D space
- Understand real-world applications like customer segmentation, image compression, and pattern discovery

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

- Dataset: [Iris Dataset / Custom Dataset / Mall Customer Dataset]
- Source: [Kaggle / sklearn / UCI ML Repository]
- Features: Numerical features such as Sepal Length, Petal Width, Age, Income, etc.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for visualization)  
  - `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`  
  - `scikit-learn` (for scaling and evaluation)

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Import and explore the dataset**
2. **Data preprocessing** (handling missing values, normalization)
3. **Apply K-Means clustering**
4. **Determine optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method**
5. **Visualize the clusters**
6. **Interpret the results**

---

## 📊 Results

- Number of clusters: `k = [optimal value]` based on Elbow Method
- Successfully visualized clusters and centroids
- Gained insights into how data points are grouped

---

## 📌 Applications

- Customer segmentation
- Market basket analysis
- Image segmentation
- Anomaly detection

---

## 💡 Future Work

- Try different clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering
- Use PCA to reduce dimensionality before clustering
- Apply to larger real-world datasets
